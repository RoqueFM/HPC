====================
plot_csv.py
====================
The run_* scripts output some csv files.

They can be plotted by using
	./plot_csv.py output_file1.csv output_file2.csv

This allows you to also plot different csv outputs together.

Additionally, a PDF is created and is called the same as the first csv file except the file name ending which is replaced by .pdf
